* B.S. in Technology, National University Autonomous of Mexico, 2012


Work experience
======
*Graduate Student Researcher, University of California, Davis (2016-present)
  * Development of new ultrafast and sensitive Silicon and Germanium-on-Silicon photodetectors, from PIN devices up to Single Photon Avalanche detectors.
  * Demonstration of new Silicon PDs that can reach 20Gbps with 5x efficiency enhacement at 850nm wavelenght.
  * Ge-on-Si PDs with 4x efficiency enhancement at 1330nm and 1550nm
  * Photodiode design for new optical interconnects in Data Centers, LiDAR and Bioimaging.
  * Participation in different product cycle process, from optical and electrical simulation, to fabrication and characterization.
  * Currently, leading the development of the Single Photon Avalanche Photodetectors.
  * Collaboration in the fabrication of a photonic integrated biosensor for molecular detection.


* Teaching Assistant, University of California Davis (Fall 2017, 2018)
  * Teaching assistant of the undergraduate senior course 'Integrated Circuits Fabrication'.
  * Coordinated +20 students to obtain hands-on experience in the fabrication of MOS transistor.
  * As a TA, I oversee students through the complete fabrication processes required for MOSFET fabrication, from the silicon wafer to the complete fabrication and its electrical characterization.
