I am Cesar Bartolo, a PhD. Student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Davis. Before that, I did my B.Sc. in Technology at UNAM and my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at INAOE, both in Mexico.
I am passionate about the integration of photonics and electronics and its potential to solve some of our challenging problems such as faster and secure communications, safer transportation systems, and high-resolution medical imaging systems for earlier detection of diseases. 

My research work focus in the development of photodetectors, which are the bridge between the optical and the electrical world, making them the key element of any optical system. My aim is to create devices that are able to detect extremely low levels of light at high speeds using nanophotonics to enhance the interaction of light with the semiconductor. My work involves the device design using optical simulations and electrical simulations, the use of nanofabrication capabilities at UC Davis and UC Berkeley and extensive analysis of the device performance. I have collaborated with my research group to develop high speed and efficient photodiodes based on silicon, germanium-on-silicon and III-V materials, covering optical wavelength from the visible to the NIR part of the spectrum.

Something that I like about my work in the capabilities to create collaboration with people in different fields such as from Material scientist and Physicists to Computer, Biomedical and Chemical engineers. In addition to photodetectors, I am developing photonics integrated biosensors using Silicon Nitride and microfluidics.
