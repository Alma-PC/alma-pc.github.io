Hi there! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Davis.  My research interests are in the development of new photonic devices and systems for optical communications and energy generation but I also believe that biosensing is one of the areas where such technology has huge potential.  

Currently, I am focused on developing photonic receivers using nanophotonics to enable high speed and efficiency of operation. It implies optical/electrical modeling, nanofabrication, and characterization. In parallel, I am obtaining a specialization in Biophotonics in the Biomedical Engineering Department, looking to find the next technological opportunity that photonics can bring in this area.
