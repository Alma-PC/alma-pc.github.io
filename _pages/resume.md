Experience
======
**Photonics Design Graduate Intern-Intel (2021-2022)**

  * Design and simulate active and passive silicon photonics components such as optical modulator, waveguide-based photodiode, polarization beam splitter/rotator, waveguide coupler, 90-deg hybrid, semiconductor optical amplifier, and tunable laser.
  * Perform process, device, optical simulations.
  * Tape out test chip for photonic integrated circuit (PIC) characterization.
  * Define test plan and characterize high-speed performance of the PIC.
  * Analyze the wafer-level-test data and die-level test data.




**Graduate Student Researcher, University of California, Davis (2016-present)**

  * Research projects:
    * Development of new ultrafast and sensitive Silicon and Germanium-on-Silicon photodetectors, from PIN devices up to Single Photon Avalanche detectors.
    * Currently, leading the development of the Single Photon Avalanche Photodetectors.
    * Collaboration in the fabrication of a photonic integrated biosensor for molecular detection.
 
  * Achievements:
    * Demonstration of new Silicon PDs with potential 20Gbps (NRZ) of operation and with 5x efficiency enhacement at 850nm wavelenght.
    * Ge-on-Si PDs with 4x efficiency enhancement at 1330nm and 1550nm.
    * Demonstration of improved Photon Detection Efficiency of silicon SPADs for LIDAR applications and PET imaging.
   * Gain-Bandwidth improvemment of silicon photodiodes by localized light absoetion in the semiconductors

  * Applications targeted:
   * Optical interconnects in Data Centers, VR/AR systems, LiDAR, PET imaging and Quantum Communicaitons.

  
  
**Teaching Assistant, University of California Davis (Fall 2017, 2018)**

  * Teaching assistant of the undergraduate senior course 'Integrated Circuits Fabrication'.
  * Coordinated +20 students to obtain hands-on experience in the fabrication of MOS transistor.
  * As a TA, I oversee students through the complete fabrication processes required for MOSFET fabrication, from the silicon wafer to the complete fabrication and its electrical characterization.
