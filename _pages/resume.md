PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
======


**Graduate Student Researcher, University of California, Davis (2019-2024)**
Carvajal-Carmona Lab
Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine

  * I led a research project focused on elucidating mutational signatures in cancer to better understand the environmental interactions in the carcinogenesis of bladder cancer. I evaluated the somatic mutational landscape of tumor samples from patients exposed to arsenic in drinking water within Latino populations, leveraging both epidemiological and genomic approaches. My findings revealed similar mutational patterns supported by genomic analysis of the Bladder Cancer TCGA dataset.

**Molecular Biology Researcher**
*Heyer Lab, University of California Davis | Davis, CA, US | Jan 2019 - Jul 2019*
  * Contributed to multiple cloning assays in yeast to investigate homologous recombination proteins, particularly the roles of Rad54 and Radh54 in forming the displacement loop, ultimately to further understand DNA repair mechanisms. Utilized techniques such as molecular cloning, novel high-throughput methods for DNA repair efficiency, and genetic testing. Active participation in lab meetings and seminars to engage with collaborative research.



**Teaching Assistant**
	* BIS 101 Genes and Genes Expression & BIS 101D ( Winter 2022 & 2024)

** Volunteer at Heyer lab-UC Davis  (January 2019 – July 2019) **
	* Collaborated with research project in the lab, such as the generation of yeast strains for specific traits used for Homologous Recombination. Trained on biochemical and molecular techniques. 
	* Academic experience: Learned how to navigate the research environment at UC Davis. 

**Student Researcher (Fall 2011- Spring 2013) ** 
 Molecular and Microbial laboratory 
	* Research focuses on survival responses of P. Putida KT2440 exposed to severe water stress.
	* Skilled in molecular biology techniques. Bacterial Genetics. Cloning.

** Interim at Pharma Quality Analyst, SON’S Chemistry Lab (Jun 2013- Dec 2013) **
	* Supervised drug development by-law regulations to ensure reliable and safe of assigned products.
	* Promoted to auditor on Quality Assurance of manufacturing drugs department. 

**Director of DIF San Salvador El Seco (April 2014-August 2016)**
	* Developed and coordinated health and social projects for poor and vulnerable communities.
	* Managed personnel.
	* Administered Institutional finances.
