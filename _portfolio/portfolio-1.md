I lead the research project focused on elucidating mutational signatures in cancer to better understand the environmental interactions in the carcinogenesis of bladder cancer. I evaluated the somatic mutational landscape of tumor samples from patients exposed to arsenic in drinking water within Latino populations, leveraging both epidemiological and genomic approaches. My findings revealed similar mutational patterns supported by genomic analysis of the Bladder Cancer TCGA dataset.
