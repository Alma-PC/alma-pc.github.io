Nowadays, new and exciting applications are emerging that requires the detection of extremely low levels of photons in the visible (380-740nm) and near infrared part of the spectrum (740-1600nm), potentially reaching the single photon level. Applications such as Light Imaging and Ranging (LIDAR), Quantum Communications and Bioimaging and Biosensing require to reach the single photon detection limit. 
My research focus in developing new Silicon and Germanium-on-Silicon based ultrafast photodetectors that can be detect minimum number of photons, through the implementation of photon trapping structures
