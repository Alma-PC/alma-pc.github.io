title: "Photonic Integrated Biosensors"
excerpt: "Silicon photonics allow the integration of ultra-sensitive biosensors in small, portable chips. I am collaborating the fabrication of photonic integrated molecular biosensor in  a Silicon Nitride platform. The project involves the design of waveguides, splitters, MZI and ring resonators in a device and a system level. Such work is done in collaboration with the department of Chemical Engineering. 1<br/><img src='/images/image_project3.png'>"
