Contributed to multiple cloning assays in yeast to investigate homologous recombination proteins, particularly the roles of Rad54 and Radh54 in forming the displacement loop, ultimately to further understand DNA repair mechanisms. Utilized techniques such as molecular cloning, novel high-throughput methods for DNA repair efficiency, and genetic testing. Active participation in lab meetings and seminars to engage with collaborative research.
